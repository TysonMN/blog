The best answer to the right question. I partner with business to identify the decision processes that are driving their success then build tools based on Machine Learning and Mathematical Planning to ensure the best possible answer, every time.

I produce articles and training material to equip software developers to build their own Mathematical Planning models to provide outstanding solutions for their clients. Few things bring me more joy than seeing others harness the tools of Mathematical Planning to help others.
